## About Me

This is Esther from Taiwan, a Front-End Developer... not yet! (?)

I learned and had lots of fun in CSS/HTML when I was 15.
To be honest, I've never ever thought of myself as a "programmer" or even a "developer"...
CSS & HTML for me, is more like an interest, not a job.

But, who knows?
I work as a Front-End Developer now. :")

I know there's still lots I have to learn and lots of catch up I need to do.
'Cause I used to focus more on design than code.
And it seems it's time to change and have a fresh start.

Never too late!
