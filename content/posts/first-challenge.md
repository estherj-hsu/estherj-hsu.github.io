## Not easy!

I love this theme.
It's really simple and clean as I need.
However, I also want to use other "advanced" function, like tags and categories...

So, here's what I'm going to do this:

<!--more-->

 - Study everything I could find online.
 - TRY and ERROR.
 - Add "tags" function into this theme.
 - Congratulations!!

I know there's still a long way to go.
I'll do my best... or just change another theme? XD
