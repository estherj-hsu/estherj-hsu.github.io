I also got a chance to have a phone screening with Apple. However, they turned me down in 10 mins right after they heard I can&rsquo;t work full time now. (And said that I could reach out once I get my PR. 🤷🏻‍♀️)</p><h3 id=the-preparation>The Preparation</h3><p>Since I was told that there&rsquo;d be both behavioural and technical questions, I spent lots of time on preparation.</p><ul><li>Studied Amazon Leadership Principles,</li><li>wrote down all the cases I could think about for behavioural questions,</li><li>watched many JS interviews on YouTube,</li><li>even tried some leetcode problems.</li></ul><h3 id=prep-call>Prep Call</h3><p>The recruiter of Amazon is really helpful.<br>He asked me to book a &ldquo;Prep Call&rdquo; after I got the confirmed date of the interview.<br>I didn&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s that, but I just booked an appointment with him and made the call 3 days before the interview.<br>He shared some tips with me and also talked about the interview process.<br>And recommended I watch some videos on Inside Amazon (Amazon Job Offical Youtube Channel).<br>I have to say; those videos helped me a lot.</p><h3 id=d-day>D-Day</h3><p>For the interview, Amazon uses &ldquo;Chime.&rdquo;<br>Since I had some bad experiences with Google Meet, I decided to attend 15 mins earlier.<br>Somehow on Chrome, it couldn&rsquo;t detect my camera and on Firefox it couldn&rsquo;t detect my headphone.<br>So I had to download and install the desktop app.<br>Chime didn&rsquo;t support background filters, so I had to ensure my background was clean.</p><p>The interviewer was a little bit late (about 2~3 mins), and there was a shadow interviewer with us.<br>He reviewed my resume and we talked about my previous position and daily routine at first.<br>Then after about 10 mins, we jumped into coding directly.</p><ol><li>CSS and HTML: how to make the text in the center of an image element.</li><li>JS: nodeTree to HTML: write a function to draw nodeTree into HTML</li><li>JS advanced: HTML to nodeTree: reverse what we did on Q2</li></ol><p>After solving each problem, he asked if I have another solution for them.<br>Also, he was supportive and provided tips for me when I met problems or paused.</p><p>About 5 mins before 1 hour, he asked me if I had any questions for him.<br>I asked about the skill they are looking for and also about my background without CS.<br>The overall interview experience was pretty nice.<br>I did my best and let&rsquo;s&mldr; follow the flow.</p></main><footer class=footer><p><small>Designed by EstherJ <span class=footer-separator>|</span> Copyright © 2026</small></p></footer><script src=/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js></script><script src=/js/jquery.fancybox.min.js></script></body></html>
