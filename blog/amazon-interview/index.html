Only about 10 days to prepare for it, and finally, it’s today!</p> </section>
<hr/>
<h3 id="phone-screening">Phone Screening</h3>
<p>I applied for three positions I found attractive on Amazon at the end of May.<br/>
Honestly, I didn’t expect them to reply that soon.<br/>
And had the phone screening in early June, they invited me for the official interview after a few days.<br/>
Then I received a link to provide the date and time that I will be available.<br/>
After a week, I finally got the confirmed date and time of the interview.<br/>
I think Amazon’s job site is better compared to Apple and Microsoft. 🤔</p>
<p>PS. I also got a chance to have a phone screening with Apple. However, they turned me down in 10 mins right after they heard I can’t work full time now. (And said that I could reach out once I get my PR. 🤷🏻‍♀️)</p>
<h3 id="the-preparation">The Preparation</h3>
<p>Since I was told that there’d be both behavioural and technical questions, I spent lots of time on preparation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Studied Amazon Leadership Principles,</li>
<li>wrote down all the cases I could think about for behavioural questions,</li>
<li>watched many JS interviews on YouTube,</li>
<li>even tried some leetcode problems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prep-call">Prep Call</h3>
<p>The recruiter of Amazon is really helpful.<br/>
He asked me to book a “Prep Call” after I got the confirmed date of the interview.<br/>
I didn’t really know what’s that, but I just booked an appointment with him and made the call 3 days before the interview.<br/>
He shared some tips with me and also talked about the interview process.<br/>
And recommended I watch some videos on Inside Amazon (Amazon Job Offical Youtube Channel).<br/>
I have to say; those videos helped me a lot.</p>
<h3 id="d-day">D-Day</h3>
<p>For the interview, Amazon uses “Chime.”<br/>
Since I had some bad experiences with Google Meet, I decided to attend 15 mins earlier.<br/>
Somehow on Chrome, it couldn’t detect my camera and on Firefox it couldn’t detect my headphone.<br/>
So I had to download and install the desktop app.<br/>
Chime didn’t support background filters, so I had to ensure my background was clean.</p>
<p>The interviewer was a little bit late (about 2~3 mins), and there was a shadow interviewer with us.<br/>
He reviewed my resume and we talked about my previous position and daily routine at first.<br/>
Then after about 10 mins, we jumped into coding directly.</p>
<ol>
<li>CSS and HTML: how to make the text in the center of an image element.</li>
<li>JS: nodeTree to HTML: write a function to draw nodeTree into HTML</li>
<li>JS advanced: HTML to nodeTree: reverse what we did on Q2</li>
</ol>
<p>After solving each problem, he asked if I have another solution for them.<br/>
Also, he was supportive and provided tips for me when I met problems or paused.</p>
<p>About 5 mins before 1 hour, he asked me if I had any questions for him.<br/>
I asked about the skill they are looking for and also about my background without CS.<br/>
The overall interview experience was pretty nice.<br/>
I did my best and let’s… follow the flow.</p> </article>  </main> <footer class="footer"> <p> <small>
